Alright, this system needs to be robust and easy to use. I shouldn't have to do ANYTHING extra to use this

2 ways to do it
Have a file for each day and clock in and out 
have a master log and parse the log
parsing the log seems significantly easier

File name can be generic because it gets cleaned as part of an accumulation script
i.e. timesheet.log

Everytime a user logs in echo
I, DATE, TIME to the file
A logout or i3lock echos
O, DATE, TIME to the same file

can be dead simple as far as the logging goes
clock -i to clock in
clock -o to clock out

Parser will have to be a bit more robust

hell with a parser, I have a better system. 

Steps
1) On login echo date, start time >> to a csv
2) On logout echo end time, total uptime \n to same csv
    Ending format:
    Date, Time in, Time out, Total
    11/11, 11:00,  12:00,    1
3) On every wednesday mv to a non-temp file for tracking and destroy csv
notes)
    - Should be robust as hell as it will log entries into a seperate entry for the same date which can be compressed manually
    - Column -s -t ',' < csv should make for easy viewing in terminal
    - should be deadsimple to implement a way to track pay periods or modifyed command for entries
